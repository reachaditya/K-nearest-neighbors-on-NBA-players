# K-nearest neighbors problem

In this problem, we will be using the K-nearest neighbors algorithm to predict how many points NBA players scored in the 2013-2014 season.
A look at the data before we dive into the algorithm. Each row in the data contains information on how a player performed in the 2013-2014 NBA season.
